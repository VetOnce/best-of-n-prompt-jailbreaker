# Best-of-N Jailbreaking Prompt Generator

This application implements the Best-of-N Jailbreaking (BoN)
method, which focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in AI
models. This version is inspired by the work of
[John Hughes and collaborators](https://jplhughes.github.io/bon-jailbreaking/)
.

- Best-Of-N prompt gen lib: [src/lib/prompt-jbgen](./src/lib/prompt-jbgen)

#### Workflow

1. **Input**:

   - Provide an initial prompt.

2. **Transformation**:

   - The application applies the BoN algorithm to the input prompt. This method will generate a transformed prompt.

3. **Output**:
   - The final transformed prompt is displayed. You can copy this prompt and paste it directly into the AI platform you wish to test.
